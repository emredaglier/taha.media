# Hook for the deploy (#17): flush everything written so far to the backup bucket and wait for it,
# e.g. right before migrations run, so a bad migration can be rolled back to this moment with
# `restore.sh -timestamp <time printed by the deploy>`. Extra args go to `docker compose` (for
# example `-f infra/compose.yaml`).
#
#   infra/litestream/snapshot.sh [compose args]
# Exit 0 only if the replica is up to date. A non-zero exit means: do not migrate.
